# Digital-holography
This repository provides two sample programs for the reconstruction of the off-axis holograms: SampleCodeWithBackground & SampleCodeWithoutBackground. I also provide a sample hologram and a sample background so that you can directly run those two programs.
Other files are the functions used in those two programs.
